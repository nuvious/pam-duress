# Contributing to PAM-Duress

Continued development on this module is welcome! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Platform.

All development will be hosted and maintained in GitHub.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [LGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

**Bug Reports Should Include**:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or mitigations/resolutions you tried and their effectiveness)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Follow the [GNU Coding styles guidelines](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Formatting) for c/c++ code.
